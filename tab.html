<h2>What is Customer Question & Answers?</h2>
        
<p>Customer Questions & Answers allows you to connect with other customers to ask or answer questions about products. You can ask questions about a product or use your own expertise to answer other customers' questions.</p>
        
<h2>What should I ask?</h2>
        
</p>Ask questions specific to the product. This is a great opportunity to get feedback from other customers who have experience with the product. Ask a question that will capture this experience. For example:</p>
        
<li>Does this camera take good quality pictures in low light?</li>
<li>How long does the battery last in this laptop while watching movies?</li>
<li>Does this computer have noisy cooling fans?</li>
<li>What shouldn't I ask?</li>
        
<h2>All posts must either be a question or an answer to a question. In addition, we reserve the right to remove questions/answers that include the following topics:</h2>
        
<li>Shipping or delivery</li>
<li>Product availability</li>
<li>Order specific information</li>
<li>Customer service</li>
<li>Material that does not comply with our Community guidelines</li>
