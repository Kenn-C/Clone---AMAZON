    <h1>AMAZON REFUND</h1>
    <h2>How Long Do Refunds Take After I Return an Item?</h2>
<li>A refund will be provided after we process your return item at our facilities. It can take up to 30 days for us to receive and process your return. In certain circumstances refund time frames may be longer.
    
    We issue the refund to the refund method you select in the Online Returns Center, and it may take additional time for your financial institution to process the refund. See below Refund Times. Learn how to Track Your Return.</li>
    
<h2>Advanced Refunds/Replacements/Exchanges</h2>
    <p>Sometimes, we issue a refund or ship a replacement/exchange to you prior to receiving the return item.</p>
    
    <h2>Advanced Refund</h2>
    
<p>In some cases, as soon as the item is dropped off by you or received by our carrier, a refund will be issued, in advance of our receipt and processing of the item at our facilities, to your credit card or as Amazon.com Gift Card balance.</p>
    
    <h2>Advanced Replacement/Exchange</h2>
    
<li>If you see an option in the Online Return Center to initiate a replacement/exchange of your original item, follow the instructions to return the item and request a replacement/exchange. If the replacement/exchange order is immediately shipped to you, you'll need to return your original item(s) by the "Return by" date referred to in your return request confirmation email or you will be charged for the replacement/exchange.
    
    Possible charges after advanced refunds/replacements/exchanges
    
    After you complete a drop off or pick up of return item(s), it may take some time for the item(s) to be transported to Amazon. Once we receive the item(s), we will verify and inspect the item(s) against the expected product(s) and quantity in your return request. If we do not receive the expected product(s) and quantity as submitted by you in your return request, or if the item(s) are not in original condition or missing parts/accessories/manuals, we will charge you the previously refunded amount (or for the previously shipped replacement/exchange order). If the charge is unsuccessful, you will be prompted to complete payment before initiating another return request.</li>
    
    <h2>To avoid being charged, take the following actions:</h2>
    
    <li>Only initiate return requests for items in their original condition
    If applicable, apply the correct mailing label.
    Drop off or pickup each item you're returning at an eligible location.
    If after completing a drop off or pick up you receive an email from us asking you to return an item or items or indicating you have been charged for the item(s), the charge will be reversed after Amazon receives and processes the item(s) and verifies the expected product(s) in your return request.</li>
